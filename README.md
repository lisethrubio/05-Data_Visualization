## Overview 

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. In this research animal study, 249 mice with SCC tumors are treated with different drug regimens over a 45-day period, while their tumor growth is closely monitored. The analysis suggests that Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective treatments in reducing tumor size, as shown by their lower average and median tumor volumes.


## Analysis

### 1. Summary Statistics Table:

- This table shows important statistics for tumor sizes for each drug regimen, including the average (mean), middle value (median), and spread (variance and standard deviation).
- Capomulin and Ramicane have the lowest average tumor sizes, suggesting that these drugs might be better at shrinking tumors compared to others.
- Drugs like Ketapril and Naftisol have a high variance, meaning their effectiveness in reducing tumor sizes varies more widely.
- The lower "SEM" (standard error of the mean) for Capomulin and Ramicane indicates more consistent results.


### 2. Bar Plot of Observed Mouse Timepoints:

- This plot shows how many observations (timepoints) were recorded for each drug regimen.
- Capomulin and Ramicane have the most observations, meaning these treatments were studied more than others.
- Propriva has the fewest observations, so conclusions about this drug might be less reliable.

### 3. Box Plot of Final Tumor Volume:

- This plot compares the range of final tumor sizes for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
- Capomulin and Ramicane have lower median tumor sizes, further supporting that they are likely more effective.
- There is an outlier in the Infubinol group, shown as a red dot, suggesting that this drug's effect can vary a lot.
- Ceftamin and Infubinol have wider ranges (larger boxes), indicating more inconsistency in their results.


### 4. Line Plot of Tumor Volume Over Time for Capomulin:

- This plot shows that, for one mouse treated with Capomulin, the tumor size decreases over time. This suggests that Capomulin is effective in reducing tumor size.


### 5. Scatter Plot of Mouse Weight vs. Average Tumor Volume (Capomulin):

- The scatter plot shows a clear trend: heavier mice tend to have larger tumors.
- The line on the plot (the red line) confirms this relationship. The correlation coefficient (0.84) indicates a strong link between weight and tumor size for mice treated with Capomulin.


Capomulin and Ramicane seem to work best at shrinking tumors based on the data.
The effectiveness of some treatments, like Ketapril and Naftisol, varies more.
For Capomulin, heavier mice usually have larger tumors.
More data was collected for Capomulin and Ramicane, giving us a better idea of their effectiveness.
